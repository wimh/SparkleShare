0.2.1 for Linux and Mac (Wed Jun 8, 2011):

        Hylke: Fix bug where host names with a "-" in them weren't accepted. Fix
        crash that happens when the user doesn't have their "Real Name" set in the 
        OS and a race condition connecting to the announcements server.


0.2 for Linux and Mac (Mon Jun 6, 2011):

	Hylke: Removed the dependancy on GitSharp. File rename detection support
	in the event logs. Fixed all crashes reported in RC1 and improved sync
        algorithm. Redid collision detection and conflict resolving (use a copy
	of each version). Improved about dialogs with version checking. Pluggable
	backend (experimental Mercurial support). Added support for Growl to show
	notifications on Mac.


0.2-rc1 for Linux and Mac (Sun Mar 20, 2011):

	Hylke: A lot of fixes and optimisations across the backend. Less memory 
	usage, less crashes. Instant notifications of new changes instead of polling.
	Refreshed event log HTML theme. Keeping logs in memory for faster reopening and
	loads more goodness.


0.2-beta2 for Mac (Sat Feb 12, 2011):

	Hylke: Mac version! Massive restructure of the code to an MVC-like model
	to make building different front-ends easier. Ported the event logs to
	Webkit, so users can style it to their liking. It also reduces the amount
	of UI-porting that needs to be done between toolkits.


0.2-beta1 (Sun Sep 5, 2010):

	Hylke: Aside from the usual bug fixes and behind the scenes work I mainly
	added features that increase productivity in the event logs. Not only does
	it look a lot prettier, each entry in an event log now has a clickable link
	for easy access to files. It refreshes automatically on new events as well.
	The Nautilus plugin now	has the "Copy Web Link" context	menu item, which
	makes sharing links a whole lot easier.
