SparkleShare
============

SparkleShare is a collaboration and sharing tool that is designed to keep
things simple and to stay out of your way. It allows you to instantly sync
with any Git repository you have access to.

Though SparkleShare is not made to be a graphical frontend 
for git or a backup tool, it may be useful for other kinds of purposes as well, 
like backing up small files or monitoring your favourite project. In contrast 
to the projects name, we will very likely refuse to implement your personal 
ponies.

SparkleShare currently works on Linux and Mac. A Windows port and mobile
device support are planned for the future.

Note:

   SparkleShare creates its own RSA keypair in ~/.ssh and uses that for
   authentication. Please mind this if you're planning to set up your own server 
   by hand.


Build on Linux:
===============

To build SparkleShare you need:

   - gtk-sharp2-devel >= 2.12.7
   - mono-core >= 2.2
   - mono-devel >= 2.2
   - monodevelop >= 2.0
   - ndesk-dbus-devel >= 0.6
   - ndesk-dbus-glib-devel >= 0.6
   - nautilus-python-devel
   - nant
   - notify-sharp-devel
   - webkit-gtk-devel
   - webkit-sharp-devel


Installing the build dependencies on Debian:

   $ sudo apt-get install gtk-sharp2 mono-runtime mono-devel monodevelop \
     libndesk-dbus1.0-cil-dev nant libnotify-cil-dev libgtk2.0-cil-dev \
     libwebkit-cil-dev intltool libtool python-nautilus libndesk-dbus-glib1.0-cil-dev

Or on Fedora:

   $ sudo yum install gtk-sharp2-devel mono-core mono-devel monodevelop \
     ndesk-dbus-devel ndesk-dbus-glib-devel nautilus-python-devel nant \
     notify-sharp-devel webkit-gtk-devel webkit-sharp-devel


You can build and install SparkleShare like this:

   $ ./configure (or ./autogen if you got SparkleShare from the repository)
   $ make
   $ sudo make install

Note:

   Use './configure --prefix=/usr' if you want the Nautilus extension to work.


Run on Mac:
===========

Just double-click the SparkleShare.app.


Build on Mac:
=============

Install the Mono Framework, Monodevelop (plus the MonoMac plugin), and MacPorts.

Install git-core, automake and intltool using 'port install'.
Make sure that git or a symbolic link to git is in /usr/bin.

Note:

   You may need to adjust some environment variables to find mono:
   
   $ export PATH=/Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Versions/Current/bin:$PATH
   $ export PKG_CONFIG=/Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Versions/Current/bin/pkg-config
   $ export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Versions/Current/lib/pkgconfig
   $ ./autogen.sh
   $ make

The last step will give you some errors, but you only need the libraries to be compiled.
Open 'SparkleShare/Mac/SparkleShare.sln' in MonoDevelop and start the build.
