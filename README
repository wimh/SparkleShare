SparkleShare 0.2 Beta 1
=======================

SparkleShare is a file sharing and collaboration tool inspired by Dropbox. 

SparkleShare isn't just a piece of software, it's part of your workflow. It's 
designed to make sharing documents and collaboration easier, and to make peers 
aware of what you are doing. It allows you to instantly sync with any Git 
repository you have access to. The user interface and features are made to 
support this goal. Though SparkleShare is not made to be a graphical frontend 
for git or a backup tool, it may be useful for other kinds of purposes as well, 
like backing up small files or monitoring your favourite project. In contrast 
to the projects name, we will very likely refuse to implement your personal 
ponies.

SparkleShare currently only works on Linux/GNOME.
Windows and OSX ports are planned for the future.
