SparkleShare 0.2 Beta 2
=======================

SparkleShare is a file sharing and collaboration tool inspired by Dropbox. 

SparkleShare isn't just a piece of software, it's part of your workflow. It's 
designed to make sharing documents and collaboration easier, and to make peers 
aware of what you are doing. It allows you to instantly sync with any Git 
repository you have access to. The user interface and features are made to 
support this goal. Though SparkleShare is not made to be a graphical frontend 
for git or a backup tool, it may be useful for other kinds of purposes as well, 
like backing up small files or monitoring your favourite project. In contrast 
to the projects name, we will very likely refuse to implement your personal 
ponies.

SparkleShare currently only works on Linux/GNOME.
Windows and OSX ports are planned for the future.

Build on Linux:
===============

To build SparkleShare you need:

   - gtk-sharp2-devel >= 2.12.7
   - mono-core >= 2.2
   - mono-devel >= 2.2
   - monodevelop >= 2.0
   - ndesk-dbus-devel >= 0.6
   - ndesk-dbus-glib-devel >= 0.6
   - nautilus-python-devel
   - nant
   - notify-sharp-devel
   - webkit-sharp-devel


Installing the build dependencies on Debian:

   $ sudo apt-get install gtk-sharp2 mono-runtime mono-devel monodevelop \
     libndesk-dbus1.0-cil-dev nant libnotify-cil-dev libgtk2.0-cil-dev \
     libwebkit-cil-dev intltool libtool python-nautilus


You can build and install SparkleShare like this:

   $ ./configure (or ./autogen if you got SparkleShare from the repository)
   $ make
   $ sudo make install

Note:

   Use './configure --prefix=/usr' if you want the Nautilus extension to work.


Run on Mac:
===========

You will need to have the Mac version of git installed.

SparkleShare will look for git in /usr/bin, so you may need to create a symbolic
link to git, depending on where it was installed:

   $ sudo ln -s /path/to/your/git /usr/bin/git

Now just double-click the SparkleShare.app.


Build on Mac:
=============

Install the Mono Framework, Monodevelop (plus the MonoMac plugin), and MacPorts.

Install git-core, automake and intltool using 'port install'.
Make sure that git or a symbolic link to git is in /usr/bin.

Note:

   You may need to adjust some environment variables to find mono:
   
   $ export PATH=/Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Versions/Current/bin:$PATH
   $ export PKG_CONFIG=/Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Versions/Current/bin/pkg-config
   $ export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Versions/Current/lib/pkgconfig
   $ ./autogen.sh

The last step will give you some errors, but you only need the libraries to be compiled.
Open 'SparkleShare/Mac/SparkleShare.sln' in MonoDevelop and start the build.


Frequently Asked Question
=========================

Q: Why is it written in Mono/C#?
A: Because I hate freedom.
